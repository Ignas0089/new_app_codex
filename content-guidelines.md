# Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- Speak in a confident, empathetic voice that emphasizes financial clarity.
- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless it is defined inline.
- Adapt tone based on context: instructional for setup, encouraging for goal tracking.

## Messaging Framework
- Lead with user value before describing product mechanics.
- Highlight security and privacy assurances when data entry is requested.
- Reinforce actionable next steps at the end of each screen or modal.

## Microcopy Standards
- Buttons: verb-first labels (e.g., "Add expense", "Save changes").
- Empty states: include purpose, benefit, and a clear call-to-action.
- Errors: state the issue, explain why it happened, and offer a recovery path.

## Localization & Inclusivity
- Support dynamic currency and date formats from user preferences.
- Avoid gendered language; prefer second-person pronouns.
- Provide alt text guidelines for illustrative media.

## Review Process
- Pair content reviews with design critiques before development handoff.
- Track approved phrasing variants in the CMS glossary.
- Run automated linting (Vale) and manual proofreads before release.
