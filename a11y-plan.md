# Accessibility Plan

## Objectives
- Ensure core flows (onboarding, transaction capture, insights review) are operable via keyboard only.
- Achieve WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for color contrast, focus visibility, and error identification.
- Provide screen reader support with accurate semantics and state announcements.

## Workstreams
1. **Design Review**
   - Incorporate color contrast checking into design QA using tokens defined in `src/design-system/tokens.json`.
   - Document focus order and skip links for each layout.
2. **Component Audits**
   - Add Storybook stories with the a11y addon for Button, Badge, Card, and Tabs.
   - Verify ARIA attributes on interactive controls (Tabs, modal triggers, form inputs).
3. **Automation**
   - Integrate axe-core checks in Vitest for critical components.
   - Run Lighthouse CI on staging for regressions.
4. **Assistive Technology Testing**
   - Schedule manual testing with NVDA + Firefox and VoiceOver + Safari.
   - Provide QA scripts covering keyboard traps, focus loops, and announcement text.

## Milestones
- **M1:** Token contrast audit complete & documented (Week 1).
- **M2:** Component-level accessibility issues resolved (Week 2).
- **M3:** End-to-end flow validation with assistive technologies (Week 3).
- **M4:** Regression monitoring wired into CI/CD (Week 4).

## Owners
- **Design:** Lead visual QA and accessible patterns (Design Systems Lead).
- **Engineering:** Implement semantic markup, ARIA, and state handling (Frontend Squad).
- **QA:** Execute AT test plans and track issues (QA Specialist).
- **Product:** Prioritize remediation work and communicate timelines.
