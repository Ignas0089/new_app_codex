# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Application shell with tab navigation that routes between Log, Budgets, Reports, and Settings pages while they are still under active construction.
- Domain schemas, Dexie database scaffolding, and service layer functions for expenses, budgets, categories, reports, and backups to support upcoming UI wiring.

### In Progress
- MVP UI: interactive logging form, budget management controls, analytics reports, and import/export flows still need to replace the placeholder copy on each tab.
