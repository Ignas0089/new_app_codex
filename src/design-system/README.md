# Design System

The design system provides the foundational building blocks for product UI implementation.
It centralizes tokens, component specifications, and usage guidelines shared across apps.

## Structure
- `tokens.json` &mdash; canonical source for colors, typography, spacing, and elevation.
- `components/` &mdash; React components that consume tokens and expose composable APIs.
- `stories/` *(optional)* &mdash; Storybook stories describing component behavior.

## Contribution Workflow
1. Update `tokens.json` with any new primitives and document rationale in PRs.
2. Implement or modify components while following accessibility and theming standards.
3. Provide Storybook stories with controls and interaction tests when behavior changes.
4. Coordinate with design for visual QA prior to merging.

## Consumption
- Components are tree-shakeable and export named modules from `src/design-system/components`.
- Tokens can be imported in CSS-in-JS or preprocessed into CSS variables via build tooling.
- For cross-project usage, publish this directory as an npm package or git submodule.

## Testing & Tooling
- Unit test components with Vitest/React Testing Library.
- Run Storybook locally with `npm run storybook` (after configuration).
- Perform accessibility audits using Storybook's a11y addon and manual keyboard review.
